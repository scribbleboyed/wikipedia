This application was created using Rails 4 and AngularJS.  It accesses the Wikipedia REST API (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) and automatically performs queries of the 'RecentChanges' module to provide a continuously synced list of 100 of the most recently updated articles on Wikipedia.

To access this application, clone this repository, run the rails server and navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3000'
